#Numerical Linear Algebra & Numerical Optimization - Assignment 1 - SFWRTECH4MA3 - McMaster University - Software Engineering

-  Implement Gauss Elimination algorithm to solve a given system of equations without using built-in functions.
-  Display matrix transformations and right side vector changes at each elimination and pivoting step.
-  Implement Gauss Elimination with partial pivoting for the same system, following similar constraints.
